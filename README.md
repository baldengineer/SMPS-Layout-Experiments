## SMPS Layout Experiments (with a MC34167)

There are four different layouts:
1. Autorouted. The parts were how KiCad placed them in pcbnew and then FreeRoute routed it.
2. 6 mil. The parts were layed out logically (and functionally). Traces were set to OSHPark's minimum and then routed manually.
3. 6 mil w/ plane. Same design as #2 but the bottom layer is designed as a ground plane.
4. Well-designed. (Hopefully) a correct design. Instead of traces, this design relies on copper "pours" to connect the critical nets.
